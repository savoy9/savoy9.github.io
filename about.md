I studied chemistry in college, and spend 5 years working in commercial laboratories in the enviromental testing industry. I did everything from benchwork to process improvement and data management to General IT work.

I used to be obessed with Long Distance Running, and then Lindy Hop, but these days its all Power BI all the time.
