I'm a Business Analyst at Microsoft. I work in Field Sales Ops for [Microsoft Advertising](https://advertising.microsoft.com/home?s_cid=dig-src_uhfcons), a large sales force responsible for selling over [$7 billon](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/MSFT_FY18Q4_10K.docx?version=b04fa6cd-ed0e-a4ea-6f4f-05c9f644b8a2) in advertisements, mostly search ads on Bing.

I studied chemistry in college, and spent 5 years working in commercial laboratories in the enviromental testing industry before going to Microsoft. I did everything from benchwork to process improvement and data management to general IT work.

I used to be obsessed with long distance running, and then lindy hop, but these days its all Power BI all the time.
